# Project Overview

Given an RSS feed app, I built tests around the functionality of the page using the Jasmine testing framework.

## To run this project, clone or download it to your local machine - then simply load the index.html file where you will see the results of all Jasmine tests, as defined in /jasmine/spec/feedreader.js. Alternatively, test the project here: https://alpe88.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/.
